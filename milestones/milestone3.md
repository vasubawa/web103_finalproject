## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Github Project board and creating issues is something we didn't know about till this milestone. Its very helpful in planning our project and we are currently planning on creating more detailed issues

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Meeing up seems to be an issue we have. Its hard to coordinate a meeting together to figure out stuff.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We did not, I am personally planning on getting the basic front/back end setup by Thrusday so it's a bit easy to work on the rest of the pages. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I would say "As a Buyer, I want to message a seller from the listing page, so that I can ask questions and arrange pickup details." This feels like an over scope in terms of feature currently with the project being due next week. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

More time if possible :) I really though we had like 2 more weeks.
