# User Stories

Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

We will use up to three user roles for YardShare:

- Visitor (not signed in): browse public listings and view basic listing details.
- Buyer (signed in): search, favorite, message sellers, and coordinate pickups.
- Seller (signed in): create and manage listings, respond to messages, and set pickup details.

## Draft User Stories

1. As a Visitor, I want to browse public listings, so that I can see available items without creating an account.
2. As a Visitor, I want to view listing details and photos, so that I can decide if an item is interesting before signing up.
3. As a Buyer, I want to create an account and sign in, so that I can save favorites and message sellers.
4. As a Seller, I want to create a new listing with title, description, price, photos, and pickup notes, so that local buyers can find and contact me about items.
5. As a Seller, I want to edit or delete my listings, so that I can correct information or remove sold items.
6. As a Buyer, I want to search listings by keyword, category, and price range, so that I can find items that match my needs and budget.
7. As a Buyer, I want to filter listings by distance from my location, so that I can prioritize items that are easy to pick up.
8. As a Buyer, I want to favorite (save) listings, so that I can easily return to items I'm considering.
9. As a Buyer, I want to message a seller from the listing page, so that I can ask questions and arrange pickup details.
10. As a Seller, I want to receive and respond to messages from interested buyers, so that I can coordinate sales and pickups.
11. As a Seller, I want to add available pickup windows and notes (e.g., curbside pickup), so that buyers know when and how to collect items.
12. As a Buyer, I want to view listings on a map with location pins, so that I can visually assess where items are located relative to me.
13. As a Seller, I want to mark an item as sold, so that it is no longer shown to buyers and my inventory is accurate.
14. As a Buyer, I want to receive basic notifications (in-app or email) for messages or when a favorited item is updated or marked sold, so that I don't miss important updates.

(Each story should be refined into acceptance criteria during sprint planning; these are the draft user stories required for Milestone 1.)
